We need to talk more about the singularitie(s). The greats of the 20th century appear to have melted their darling wings on the sun of the pre-y2k information-age. I don't understand why the great philosophy of the past 50 years hasn't been about the digital/analogue singularity its the most important thing I can think of other than the intrinsically human singularities like time and cognition. I posit that we could have got started with the machine learning revolution 50 years ago and that we have more or less had the tools this whole time. It's not truly an engineering (consumer product/chipset), its an ontology problem - the truly dualistic data structure can reverse its own logic and give the chip blue prints straight to the fab, cutting out a few steps.

description: |
Logical arity is seemingly the fulcrum of multiscale epistemological so-called emergence, broadly, 'information'. This would imply that Category & Morphism are fundemental, while Set is emergent. Heisenberg, Dirac, and Yoneda give us the formalism for such an ontology.

I applogize for my poor bibliographical-hygene, but for my intents-and-purposes, aknowledging the creator or inventor as a proper-noun within the concepts core-description, is the best I can-do for now. For example:


> “One ought to concentrate one’s attention on things which are grossly connected with what one can observe.  
> The things one can observe, being each related to two states, are expressed naturally as a matrix-array of numbers.  
> One should consider the whole set of numbers, together.”
