We need to talk more about the singularitie(s). The greats of the 20th century appear to have melted their darling wings on the sun of the pre-y2k information-age. I don't understand why the great philosophy of the past 50 years hasn't been about the digital/analogue singularity its the most important thing I can think of other than the intrinsically human singularities like time and cognition. I posit that we could have got started with the machine learning revolution 50 years ago and that we have more or less had the tools this whole time. It's not truly an engineering (consumer product/chipset), its an ontology problem - the truly dualistic data structure can reverse its own logic and give the chip blue prints straight to the fab, cutting out a few steps.
